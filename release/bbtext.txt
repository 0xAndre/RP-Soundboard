RP Soundboard Plugin

Easy to use soundboard to annoy your friends. Play any sound file to all people in your channel (and yourself).
No external tools and no changes to Teamspeaks settings required!

Here you have it, an easy to use soundboard for Teamspeak 3. No need for complicated hotkey binding, no need to fiddle with voice activation settings or the like, no need to use virtual audio cable or other external tools.
Just choose the number of buttons you want to have on your board, choose the files you want to play and off you go!
Supports all kinds of formats, including mp3, mp4, wav, ogg, flac, wma, avi. You can even use most video files. Of course you only can hear their audio track. This is'nt a video player.

System requirements:
- Windows Vista/7/8/8.1 (32 or 64 bit)
(Mac and Linux versions are certainly possible in the future, just tell me that there is a demand)

Installation:
Download the ts3_plugin file from the download section below. Double klick it and follow the instructions.

Usage:
Once installed you can open the soundboard via Teamspeaks main menu:
- Go to Plugins -> RP Soundboard -> Open Soundboard.

Keyboard hotkeys can be set up using Teamspeaks built in hotkey configuration menu:
- Go to Settings -> Options -> Hotkeys.
- Press the button "add" on the bottom of the window
- Press "Show Advanced Actions" on the bottom of the appearing dialog
- Expand Plugins -> Plugin Hotkey -> rp_soundboard
- Start setting up the hotkeys
I am not responsible for the horrible sorting, that is a feature(tm) of Teamspeak

Please note:
This plugin is still in development. Any kind of constructive feedback is appreciated. Feel free to post into this thread or send me an email: rpsb@mgraefe.de
Your microphone is constantly open (picking up your voice) while a sound is played unless you check "Mute myself during playback". That is due to the limited access that plugins have to the sound interface of Teamspeak and cannot be changed currently. However I do not think that this is that important.
